    <p>Calculates a moving average over a configurable number of messages.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>Amount <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
        <dd>
            The number of messages over which the moving average is calculated.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>Moving averages are calculated per topic.</dd>
        
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">number</span>, <span class="property-type">boolean</span>, <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Whats happens depends on the type of the payload:</p>
            <h4><span class="property-type">number</span></h4>
            <p>When a number is received, it is added to the array of
            numbers over which the moving average is calculated.</p>
            <h4><span class="property-type">boolean</span></h4>
            <p>When a boolean is received, it is converted to a number, which is added to the array of numbers over which the moving average is calculated.</p>
            <h4><span class="property-type">string</span></h4>
            <p>When a string is received, it is interpreted as a command for
            the node:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><pre>get</pre>: no number is added, only returns the
                    current moving average.</li>
                    <li><pre>count</pre>: no number is added, returns the
                    number of numbers currently stored.</li>
                    <li><pre>pop</pre>: no number is added but the oldest
                    received number is removed.</li>
                    <li><pre>clear</pre>: all stored numbers for the current
                    topic are removed.</li>
                </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>The output is a the message that was received, with payload set to
    the current moving average.</p>
    <p>If there is no average, (for example after the clear command is used) the payload is set to 0.</p>
    <p>If you want to get the current moving average without adding a
    number, set a message with "get" as the payload.</p>
    <p>If the count command is used, the payload is not set to the current
    moving average, but to the amount of numbers currently in memory.</p>
